### **Instructions to Run the Site Locally**

1. **Run the site locally.**
   - In the PowerShell terminal, run the command **`bundle install`** in the path where your repository is located locally.
   - Bundler will install the dependencies specified in the `Gemfile`.

2. **Handling Errors:**
   - If you encounter an error like:
     ```
     An error occurred while installing wdm (0.1.1), and Bundler cannot continue.
     ```
   - You should run `gem install <package>`. In this case, the `<package>` is `wdm`. So, execute:
     ```
     gem install wdm
     ```
   - Check the version of the installed package and modify the `Gemfile` with the new version of the `<package>` that caused the error initially.
   - Then, run the command `bundle install` again.

3. **Verifying Dependencies:**
   - Once the previous command is executed, you can check that a `Gemfile.lock` file has been created. Inspecting it will show all the installed dependencies. It’s not crucial, but just verify it.

4. **Starting the Local Server:**
   - Once the dependencies are installed, run:
     ```
     bundle exec jekyll s
     ```
   - The execution of this command will point you to the web server address, something like `http://localhost:4000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`.


### **Pushing to Your GitHub Repository**
1. **Let’s do our first push to our GitHub repository.**
   - If you carefully check the GitHub repository and contrast it with the local repository, you will see that there are obvious differences. This is because we haven’t updated the GitHub repository with the current state of the local repository.
   - Therefore, we need to push our local repository to the GitHub repository. We will use the Git application that we installed at the beginning of this tutorial.
   - To push this local repository, execute the following command in another PowerShell terminal:
     ```
     bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux
     ```
   - Now, run the following three commands:
     ```
     git add --all
     git commit -m "some comment about the change done"
     ```

2. **First-time Setup:**
   - For first-timers, you will need to run:
     ```
     git config --global user.email "youremail@email.com"
     git config --global user.name "yourusername"
     ```
   - Re-execute the commit command:
     ```
     git commit -m "some_comment"
     ```
   - Finally, push your changes:
     ```
     git push
     ```
     - You will be prompted to a sign-in website. Just sign in with your GitHub credentials.
  
    - My Changes

3. **Checking Updates:**
   - Update your GitHub repository to check the changes.
   - In the GitHub repository, check the **Actions** button. You will see the workflow corresponding to the comment with which you did the `git commit` command.
   - Now, you can check your public web server by accessing the link referred to inside the workflow. For instance, `https://<your_username>.github.io`. Click on the link, and you will be redirected to the public website on GitHub where your site is hosted.

  - My site web
    ``https://silvadiana.github.io``

## **1.2. Creating Your First Blog Post**

1. **Start feeding your blog. Let’s create our first post.**
   - Under the folder `_posts`, create a new file with the name `year-month-day-some_name.md`.
   - Check the Home tab on the local website, and you will see your first post.
   - Every post should have a header like this:
     ```
     ---
     title: First post ever
     date: 2024-09-27 00:00:00 +09:00
     categories: [keyword1, keyword2]
     tags: [experiment, scanning, execution]  # TAG names should always be lowercase
     ---
     ```

2. **Updating Your Local Website:**
   - Update your local website and check the changes in the Home or Archives tab.
   - For the content, it's up to you to learn some Markdown coding, which is quite easy.
   - Refer to the code instructed in class or explore various online resources (tutorials, YouTube videos, etc.) to learn Markdown.

3. **Adding Images:**
   - Pay attention to how you include images and where to store them:
     ```
     ![some reference text for the image](/assets/images/firstimage.png)
     ```

4. **Pushing Changes:**
   - Every time you feel you’ve made enough progress for a push, repeat the three commands:
     ```
     git add --all
     git commit -m "some comment"
     git push
     ```
